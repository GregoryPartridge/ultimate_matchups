# Ultimate Matchups
This repository contains two main components: `download_match_data.py` and `smash_online_analysis.ipynb`.
The first script downloads the data to be used by the notebook.
Be warned, due to the rate limit and the large amount of data being downloaded, it will take on the order of ten hours to download everything.

The dependencies can be found in the environment.yml file and installed with `conda env create -f environment.yml`.
If you do not already have conda installed you can find it [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

The dataset can also be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A4Ik03h5CrmnevD-VGZ0qtBJT6NjyXOc/view?usp=sharing) to avoid having to wait on the script.

EDIT

The updated dataset as of August 2021 can be downloaded along with all character's stage benifit [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Te47zQdXvq02Nk_6uaB8F8tkxRRfotjd?usp=sharing).
